Enter text you want to encrypt into the top text box, type a password, and
press the Encrypt button.  The obfuscated (encrypted) text will appear in the
bottom textbox.
To decode obfuscated text, paste it into the bottom textbox, type or paste the
password, and press the Decrypt button.  The decoded text will appear in the top
textbox.

If you get the password wrong, it will just decode it wrongly and you will
simply still not be able to read the text.

It only modifies letters and numbers, preserving case and symbols.

This code's algorythms are not yet compatible with the c# version:

It is subject to change, so expect any currently encoded text to not be able to
be decoded in the future in case of algorithm changes in the future.
